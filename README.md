# dice-game
 This is a simple two-player Dice Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each player rolls a virtual dice, and the result is displayed with corresponding dice images. The game randomly generates numbers (1â€“6) and updates the images dynamically on refresh. The winner is declared based on which player rolls the higher number, or it's a draw.
